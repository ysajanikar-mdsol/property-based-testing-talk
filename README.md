# Property based testing
The property based testing is a popular tool with functional programmers. I have created a python based notebook which also acts as a presentation to demonstrate property based testing.

# Running the notebook

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) 

## Installing packages

```bash
poetry install

```

## Running the jupyter

```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

## Turning on the presentation mode
When inside the notebook in the browser, click on the *presentation* icon at the top.
